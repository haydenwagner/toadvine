## company-growth-graph
D3 graph to show company growth over time. A user can click buttons to increase/decrease the year and see the corresponding company metrics for that year. Currently the graph shows three metrics:
- Number of product lines (or equivalent)
- Number of employees
- Performance line graph (sales, subscribers etc.)

This project was inspired by [Jetbrain's 'Our History' interactive visual](https://www.jetbrains.com/company/).
