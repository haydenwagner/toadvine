##enter-update-exit
The data join concept is central to D3&mdash;if you have never heard of it before you should read [this post](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/join/) by D3's creator, Mike Bostock.

This concept is easy to understand once you understand it. The problem for me was that, for whatever reason, I wasn't able to fully wrap my head around it for a while.

**I made this visual to show the concept, and allow users to manually trigger the enter, update, and exit states**. The data is an array of x/y coordinates that is visible to the user, and the visual elements are points that correspond to the coordinate data. 

Press the buttons to see how the changing data drives the visual.
