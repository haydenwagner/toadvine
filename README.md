##visitor-map-ise
A demonstration of a precise svg path overlaying a static image. Once the path is overlayed interactive features can be addedâ€”this visual shows a plotted stationary transparent circle, and an animated smaller cirle that follows the train track found in the image.

The image is a Japanese tourist map found in The Visual Display of Quantitative Information by Edward Tufte.

This idea could have some interesting applications (or maybe not). It's a proof of concept right now.
