# toadvine

![toadvine repo][image]

**toadvine consists of different branches of visualizations and smaller (not repo worthy) code projects.**

The master branch contains a minimal project template (HTML page with linked CSS and JS files) which forms the basis for each new project.

I tried to keep the dependencies to a minimum&mdash;D3 and lodash are included, and a few NPM modules and scripts to compile SCSS and inline content for new Gists.
